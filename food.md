# Favorite Food!

I have many _favorite_ foods! However **none** of them are quite as good as **_sushi_**.

## Sushi!
Some of my favorite sushi ingredients are:
* rice
* seaweed
* salmon
* avocado
* tuna
* crab
* and many others!

I live right down the street from a *very* good sushi restaurant. I hope you all can try!
